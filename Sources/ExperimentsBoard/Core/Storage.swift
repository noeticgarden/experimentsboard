    /**
     A low-level, thread-safe storage type that coordinates editing experiments.
     
     You don't generally interact with this type unless:
     - you want to segregate some experiments and control their lifecycle; or
     - you're building a low-level observer for experiments, such as editor UI.
     
     If possible, use the ``Experiments`` type to interact with experiments instead; see its documentation
     for details. For example, to control the lifecycle of some experiments, see the examples in that documentation
     for how to build a separate store and interact with it.
     
     If that API is not sufficient, use the ``raw`` property on this type to obtain direct accessors
     to the storage and perform editing or lookup operations.
     
     Uses of ``Experiments`` that do not specify a store will interact with the default store, accessible via the ``default`` property.
     
     ### Raw Access & Thread-Safety
     
     Use the methods in the ``Raw`` interface to access the contents of this storage. A storage instance can contain:
     
     - Experiment definitions, accessible through ``Raw/subscript(experimentFor:)``, determine
     what type of experiment is conducted, what the default value is, and options such as acceptable ranges for numeric experiments. See ``ExperimentDefinition`` for more.
     
     - Value overrides, accessible through ``Raw/subscript(_:)``, cause the `value(â€¦)` methods of
     the ``Experiments`` type to return different values for their experiments.
     
     You can perform single-key accesses or get a bulk copy of either dictionary using the ``Raw/values`` and ``Raw/experiments``
     properties, or even of the entire state of the storage using the ``Raw/state`` property.
     
     Each access performed through these accessors is atomic, synchronous, and unrelated to other accesses
     any code performs on the same ``Storage``, including through different ``Raw`` interfaces. This guarantees
     correctness of the storage in the face of multiple actors or threads using it concurrently.
     
     > Important: Each use of an accessor in ``Raw`` is protected by a mutex. Concurrent usage is supported,
     but you may need to think about issues such as time-of-access-to-time-of-use, lost reads, or lost writes in
     your invoking code.
