    /**
     Allows code that uses the Observation module, like SwiftUI, to observe changes in experiment storage.
     
     Each instance of this class is associated with one ``Experiments/Storage`` and will produce
     change callbacks that can be tracked by [`withObservationTracking(_:onChange:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation/withobservationtracking(_:onchange:)) whenever any experiment definition or value changes in the storage instance.
     
     To ensure updates occur, access experiment information within that block (or within a similarly tracked context, like a SwiftUI `View`'s `body`) by using the ``snapshot`` or ``states`` properties.
     
     Using the static methods of the ``Experiments`` type will also similarly trigger observation callbacks for the ``Experiments/Storage/default`` storage instance. You only need to create instances of this class if you want experiment state information, on top of experiment values; or if you want to follow the state of a different storage instance.
     
     > Note: This class is bound to the main actor. To observe the state of storage outside of the main actor, use ``ExperimentsObserver`` instead.
