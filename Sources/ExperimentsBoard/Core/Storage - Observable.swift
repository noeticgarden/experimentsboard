     Allows code that uses the Observation module, like SwiftUI, to observe changes in experiment storage.
     
     Each instance of this class is associated with one ``Experiments/Storage`` and will produce
     change callbacks that can be tracked by [`withObservationTracking(_:onChange:)`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/observation/withobservationtracking(_:onchange:)) whenever any experiment definition or value changes in the storage instance.
     
     To ensure updates occur, access experiment information within that block (or within a similarly tracked context, like a SwiftUI `View`'s `body`) by using the ``snapshot`` or ``states`` properties.
     
     Using the static methods of the ``Experiments`` type will also similarly trigger observation callbacks for the ``Experiments/Storage/default`` storage instance. You only need to create instances of this class if you want experiment state information, on top of experiment values; or if you want to follow the state of a different storage instance.
     
     ## Concurrency
     
     Instances of this class are not `Sendable` and remain isolated to one isolation context at a time.
     
     If you want to use an observer that is isolated to the main actor, use the ``init(_:)`` initializer. Observation callbacks will be sent isolated to that actor.
     
     If you want to isolate callbacks to another  isolation context, use the ``init(_:executor:)`` callback. The closure you provide must eventually call the ``refresh()`` method in the context of your choice, and the change callbacks will be emitted isolated to that specific context.
     
     For example:
     
     ```swift
     actor MyActor {
        var observable: Observable?
     
        init(store: Experiments.Storage) {
            observable =
                Experiments.Observable(store)
                { [weak self] in
                   await self?.refresh()
                }
        }
     
        private func refresh() {
            observable?.refresh()
        }
     }
     ```
    
     Since ``Observable`` isn't `Sendable`, the call to ``refresh()`` ensures that the change callbacks are occurring in the isolation context that owns the ``Observable`` instance.
